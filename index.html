			<h4>Week 0</h4>
			<p>The main thing I've figured out over the first week of class is that I have a LOT to learn.  I had been taking
			some Web Development and JavaScript courses online and have put basically none of that knowledge to use.  Not
			because it was useless to learn, just that the classes so far have showed me there's a completely different
			set of skills that I haven't even started to grow.  Hopefully, the knowledge that I do have will prove itself
			useful in the future, but for now I'm enjoying learning new things.</p>
